                Minimalism combined with elements of french typography and
                brutalism helped us to realize the site exactly as we imagined
                with the client at the same beginning: visually restrained, but
                stylish. Informative and pleasant to use, with an elegant
                aftertaste of a serious financial institution. Combined with
